What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   
   Git creates a hidden directory for tracking changes inside that directory but does not commit any files
   that are already there. You need to do it in order for git to initialize the history for that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

   The staging area is an area that stands between the working directory and the repository, allowing
   you to decide and make a logical bundle which contains the files from your working directory you 
   will commit to the repository in the next stage.
