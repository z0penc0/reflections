When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I would like to share my work with people.
	When I need a backup to store my files more securely. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Cause I prefer to have control over the state of my working copy, knowing what I have. Automatically pulling changes can lead to errors, conflicts between versions or missing changes in your files.
